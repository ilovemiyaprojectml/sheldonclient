# HTML5 Framework

## Distribution Package

This repository is a bower package that lets you easily install the core features of the HTML5 Framework. If you are looking for the development repositories (because you want to look at the framework code or maybe contribute to it), have a look at the [HTML5 Framework Build repository](https://services.sungard.com/git/projects/HTML5/repos/html5-framework-build).

## Download

There are three different ways to get a hold of the framework.

We recommend using the [HTML5 Yeoman Generator](https://internal.csa.sungard.com/HTML5/yeoman-generator.html) as it also
provides you with a full JavaScript development environment that follows the technology's best practices and tools.

### Using The [HTML5 Yeoman Generator](https://internal.csa.sungard.com/HTML5/yeoman-generator.html)

If you have used the HTML5 Yeoman Generator to create your project, you already have a bower dependency to this package
and the framework is ready to use. Creating a new project is as simple as running the
following command:

```
yo html5
```

### Using [Bower](http://bower.io)

```
bower install --save https://services.sungard.com/git/scm/bower/html5-framework.git
```

This will download this package locally inside bower's default install directory and will add the dependency to a local bower.json file.

### Downloading The Files

Since the framework is made of JavaScript files, you can also simply download the files from this package.
This can be useful for quick prototypes or if you want to take care of your development environment yourself.
By using the HTML5 Yeoman Generator however, you will not have to create the development environment needed for
you to build, test, concatenate, minify, manage dependencies and all the things needed to work efficiently on JavaScript application.

You can download this package by clicking on the *Download* button to the right of [this package](https://services.sungard.com/git/projects/BOWER/repos/html5-framework)'s name in SunGard Git.

## Files In This Package

The files that end with "*.min.js*" are files that were minified and that should be used in production environments.

- *fis-fmk-core.js*: this file contains the entirety of the HTML5 Framework.
If you use this file, you will also need to include the framework dependencies in your application. See fis-fmk-core-deps.js for this.
You can know the different dependencies of the framework by looking at the bower.json of this package, under the "dependencies" section.
- *fis-fmk-core-deps.js*: this file conveniently bundles all the framework's dependencies inside a single file. You can use it alongside fis-fmk-core.js.
If you do, make sure it is inserted first in your index.html file.
- *fis-fmk-core-mega.js*: this file is a combination of both of the above files.
If you use this file, you don't need to insert any other file in your index.html file.

As for all static files, always remember to use proper HTTP caching for serving these files.
This will improve the performance of your application.
