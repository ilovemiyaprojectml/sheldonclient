# Dynamic Segment

This control is used to change or filter a view. It is typically used on touchscreens and is increasingly used as a replacement for traditional dropdown controls when options are limited to just a few. It's dynamic as it takes `items` array as an input.

### Responsiveness

The segment uses flex to control the position of its items. The segment bar takes width from parent container. Width of individual segment items is adjusted based on the width of the parent.

## Accessibility

This component assigns a role attribute of `menubar` and a role of `menuitem` to each of the items.

The segment component also participates in tabbed navigation. You can use keyboard tab to assign focus and `enter` or `space` key to select an item.

## Inputs

### items

Type: RufDynamicSegmentItem[]

The collection to be rendered. An item has following attributes:

| Property | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| label | string | Required. The display name for the item. |
| path | string | Required. Path to uniquely identify this item. | 
| tooltipText | string | Tooltip text to be displayed on item hover. |
| params | object | Optional. Params to be passed to the select output emitter for this item |

### selectedPath

Type: string

Optional. Use this property to control the item that should be activated. 
A path is simply an identifier for an item. Each segment item will use a "startsWith" matching strategy to determine if it is selected or not.
This means that if you have an items with a paths as `users` and `users/me`, `selectedPath` with value as `users/me` will activate both the items.

Note: changing this property fires select event.

### showActiveItemClip

Type: boolean

This property decides whether we need to show an active item clip below the segment item when it is selected.

## Outputs

### select

Path to uniquely identify this item is emitted on clicking an item in the menu. 

| Property | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| path | string | Required. Path to uniquely identify this item | 

## Examples

<ruf-dynamic-segment rufId [items]="items" [showActiveItemClip]="true" [selectedPath]="selectedItem.path"></ruf-dynamic-segment>
