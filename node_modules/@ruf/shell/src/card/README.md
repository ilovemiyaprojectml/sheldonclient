# rufCard

Cards are an element within the UI that serve the purpose of grouping related data together. Typically, cards show a glimpse of information, which allows the user to then act on it by drilling down into more detail.
The card should also have an ability to collapse/expand to hide/show the card content area.

[]()                 | []()
-------------------- | --------------------
Selector             | ruf-card
Class                | RufCardComponent
Module name          | RufCardModule
Presentational       | Yes
FIS UX Guidelines    | [Cards](https://ux.fisglobal.com/ux/menutouch.html#/cards)
Internationalized    | Yes
Dependencies         | None

## Appearance and Behavior

The general appearance of the card component will be driven by the FIS UX Style Guide.

Note that cards need to be displayed on a canvas that provides a little bit of contrast with the card's background. We provide a `ruf-card-canvas` class that you can apply to the element that will contain cards. This class simply applies the `card-canvas` background color to the element. The default color for this is `#eee`;

### Responsiveness

Cards should have fluid layouts so the content can wrap and visual elements can scale based on the available width. The height of the card will grow based on the content within the card.

## Accessibility

The expand/collapse control participates in tabbed navigation and has configurable `expandLabel` and `collapseLabel` inputs to modify its aria-label.
We also make sure tabbed navigation cannot happen if the content is hidden.

```html
<ruf-card ...  [expandLabel]="'Click to expand'" [collapseLabel]="'Click to collapse'">
...
</ruf-card>
```

## Body

The body of the `ruf-card` can contain arbitrary content. The content has no padding by default which lets you control it based on the content. You can use the RUF layout directives to declaratively adjust padding and margin.

The body can also contain special elements:

* ruf-card-controls
* ruf-card-subtitle
* ruf-card-action-bar

Each are described later in this document.

## Internationalization

The ARIA labels for expand and collapse icon can be localized using two ways.
  1. The component uses `card.aria.expandLabel` and `card.aria.collapseLabel` from `RufShellIntl` for default value. Provide your own implementation of this class to override this value. For more information, check `String Translations` section from I18n documentation.
  2. Use `expandLabel` and `collapseLabel` attributes. This takes precedence over the `RufShellIntl` provider.
  ```html
  <!-- ARIA label value for expand icon is 'Expand card' and for collpase icon is 'Collapse card' -->
  <ruf-card [expandLabel]="'Expand card'" [collapseLabel]="'Collapse card'"></ruf-card>

  <!-- ARIA label value for expand icon is 'Expand' and for collpase icon is 'Collapse' which is default value from RufShellIntl -->
  <ruf-card>...</ruf-card>
  ``` 

## Inputs

### title

Type: string

Title of the card. This will be displayed in the header section of the card.

### expandable

Type: boolean

If set to true, the card header section will have an animated chevron that will control the expand/collapse behavior of the card. When the card is in collapsed state, only the card header is visible.

### expanded

Type: boolean

Controls the expanded state of the card.

```html
<button mat-button (click)="expandAll = !expandAll">Expand/Collapse</button>
<ruf-card ... expanded="expandAll">
...
</ruf-card>
```

### expandLabel, collapseLabel

Type: string

These inputs let you change the aria-label of the expand/collapse toggle button.

## RufCardControlsDirective

This element allows inserting elements in the right portion of the card's header. You can use this area to add metrics and a menu icon for example.

[]()                 | []()
-------------------- | --------------------
Selector             | `ruf-card-controls`
Class                | `RufCardControlsDirective`

### Example

```html
<ruf-card title="My Card">
  <p rufMargin>Card content</p>
  <ruf-card-controls fxLayout>
    <div fxLayout="column">
      <span class="ruf-card-metric">100</span>
      <span class="ruf-card-metric-description">Total users</span>
    </div>
    <button mat-icon-button fisStyle>
      <mat-icon fisIcon="vertical-ellipsis" alt="Card Menu"></mat-icon>
    </button>
  </ruf-card-controls>
</ruf-card>
```

## RufCardSubtitleDirective

This element allows inserting elements right below the title. You can use this area to add a meaningful description for the card or add a mat-select dropdown for example.

[]()                 | []()
-------------------- | --------------------
Selector             | `ruf-card-subtitle`
Class                | `RufCardSubtitleDirective`

### Example

```html
<ruf-card title="My Card">
  <p rufMargin>Card content</p>
  <ruf-card-subtitle>The title of the card also acts like a toggle</ruf-card-subtitle>
</ruf-card>
```
