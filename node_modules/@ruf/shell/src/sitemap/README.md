# Sitemap

The RUF Sitemap component is used to display a hierarchy of selectable navigation items within a specified content area. The Sitemap fills its container in order to make as many navigation items visible to reduce the amount of user interactions required to find their desired item.

## Appearance and Behavior

The component is comprised of a flex container filled with lists of selectable sitemap items. Each item can be selected to fire a selection event.

### Styling

Colors are, by default, inherited from the parent. 

### Responsiveness

The sitemap uses flex to control the position of its internal sitemap items. The number of columns adjusts based on the width of the screen upon which the sitemap is rendering. This component is not recommended for use on phones due to screen width, so the recommended approach would be to use ruf-if to switch to a more appropriate navigation component on the smaller screen widths.

## Accessibility
### ARIA Attributes
This component assigns a role attribute of menubar to itself and a role of menuitem to the ruf-sitemap child's anchor element.
### Keyboard Accessibility
Keyboard navigation is implemented according to ARIA Guidelines.
After tabbing into the sitemap the following applies:
* `UP-ARROW` or `LEFT-ARROW` moves focus upward within the sitemap, and recycles focus to the bottom of the sitemap if pressed on the top-most item
* `DOWN-ARROW` or `RIGHT-ARROW` moves focus downwards within the sitemap, and recycles focus to the top of the sitemap if pressed on the bottom-most item
* `SPACE` or `ENTER` will fire the select event. 

See (ARIA Guidelines)[https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wiki/Using_ARIA_menus] for menus
