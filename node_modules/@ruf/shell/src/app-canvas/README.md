## Appearance and Behavior

The general appearance of the Application Canvas is meant to be transparent providing an area between the Application Banner and the Application Footer.

### Styling

The styling for this component will mostly be driven off of the selected theme. Additional variables will be used for general placement using padding within the canvas container.

List of variables and their default value.

### Responsiveness

Use the framework's layout directives to control the responsiveness of the elements placed in the app canvas.

## Accessibility

Until we have defined how to manage ARIA hints in an internationalized way, this is TBD.

## Examples

```html
<ruf-app-canvas>
  router outlet
</ruf-app-canvas>
```
