# RufToggle Directive

This attribute directive can be used on any element. It will have a `value` boolean property that will get toggled when the element is clicked or selected using SPACE or ENTER key.
It will set click and keydown listeners on the host and stop the propagation so that the click/keydown is not passed to the underlying element.
This directive will also add a class to the element, so that an animated chevron with CSS can be added on it.
The underlying element can use the `value` property to control whatever it might want to.

The directive extends from CdkOverlayOrigin from Material, to make it usable as an origin for an Overlay.


[]()                 | []()
-------------------- | --------------------
Selector             | [rufToggle], [rufToggleChevron], [rufToggleArrow]
Class Name           | RufToggleDirective
Module name          | RufToggleModule
Export As            | rufToggle

## Styling

The directive will add the following classes to the element it is attached to:

Class Name         | Description
------------------ | -----------
ruf-toggle         | Base class
ruf-toggle-normal  | If you used the rufToggle attribute.
ruf-toggle-chevron | If you used the rufToggleChevron attribute instead of rufToggle.
ruf-toggle-arrow   | If you used the rufToggleArrow attribute instead of rufToggle.
ruf-toggle-active  | If the current value of the toggle is true.

## Inputs

### rufToggle, rufToggleChevron, rufToggleArrow

You can pass the initial state of the toggle in the directive's attribute. If you do not pass a value, the initial value is false.

```html
<button [rufToggle]="myInitialState">Normal Toggle</button>
<button [rufToggleChevron]="true">Chevron toggle</button>
<button rufToggleArrow>Arrow toggle</button>
```

The rufToggleChevron and rufToggleArrow attribute both depend on the fisfont, which can be found in the @ruf/fis-ux-assets NPM package. Each will respectively add an animated fis-icon-chevron and an fis-icon-arrow-down icon to the toggle element.

## Outputs

### toggleChange

Event fired when toggle is triggered. The event has the following properties:

| Property       | Type   | Description |
| -------------- | ------ | ------------|
| trigger        | ElementRef | Element reference of trigger. |
| value          | boolean    | toggle value. |
| event          | Event  | Original event that triggered this toggle. |


## Usage

```html
<button [rufToggle]="true" #myTrigger="rufToggle">
  Toggle
</button>
<div [hidden]="myTrigger.value">
  Some div that is shown/hidden on basis of rugToggle directive
</div>
```

```html
<button rufToggle (toggleChange)="trigger = $event">
  Toggle
</button>
<div [hidden]="!trigger?.value">
  Some div that is shown/hidden on basis of rugToggle directive
</div>
```

In the above example, we create a reference to `rufToggle` directive using a template reference called "myTrigger". The `value` property of the directive is then used to show/hide the div element.

The following one is nearly identical with the exception that the initial state is false (default) and that the button will have a chevron displayed to the right of the button label.

```html
<button rufToggleChevron #someTrigger="rufToggle">
  Toggle
</button>
<div [hidden]="someTrigger.value">
  Some div that is shown/hidden on basis of rugToggle directive
</div>
```
