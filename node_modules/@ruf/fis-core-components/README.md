#HTML5 Framework Core Components

This package contains the core components of the framework. These components take care of many cross-cutting concerns that most applications have and are used by all the other framework modules.

##Installation

If you use the [full framework package](https://services.sungard.com/git/projects/BOWER/repos/html5-framework) like most people do, it will be automatically included in your application and you do not need to add this package separately. If you are not using another of the [framework packages](https://services.sungard.com/git/projects/HTML5) that has a dependency on this one, you will need to make sure this package is installed as a dependency of your application to be able to use the framework.

To install in your application, you need to run the following bower command:

    bower install --save https://services.sungard.com/git/scm/html5/html5-framework-core-components.git

##Contents

Don't be afraid to [browse the repository](https://services.sungard.com/git/projects/HTML5/repos/html5-framework-core-components/browse/app/fis-components/js) for a complete list of components which are separated into services, directives and filters. Search [our wiki](https://www.csa.sungard.com/wiki) if you see something missing.

###Configuration Service

Easily inject configuration that is global to your app into your controllers, directives and services. This configuration can be static or generated on the server. See [Configuration Service](https://www.csa.sungard.com/wiki/x/ggfNAg).

###Metadata-Driven Navigation

Define metadata to represent all your views, organize them and let navigation widgets take care of showing it to your users. The [view structure](https://www.csa.sungard.com/wiki/x/eMlJAw) you create can be static or generated on the server, but the nice thing is you can use any existing widget that understands it.

* [fisViewPanelService](https://www.csa.sungard.com/wiki/x/nwIiAw)

###Virtual Views

The framework supports the capability of opening multiple views at the same time into different View Panels. This allows your users to switch between view panels without losing the work they did in the view panel they were on. The AngularJS scope for the view panels that are not visible are automatically frozen to make sure you don't lose performance the more you open tabs.

###Localize The Text In Your Application

Interact with your users in their language.

* [I18n Service](https://www.csa.sungard.com/wiki/x/zgMiAw)

###Easily Access Data

Easily access that simply by adding support for fisData in your directive. Represent complex filter criteria in a reusable way that is compatible with fisData. Provide access to your backend data without the need to write JavaScript... and more!

###Intercept HTTP Errors

Be notified when HTTP errors occur so that you can react at a global level.

###Client Storage Service

A service to facilitate using the browser's client-side storage capabilities.

###Client-side PubSub

Publish on a topic or subscribe to one.

##Getting Started

To get started with the framework, visit the [HTML5 Framework's homepage](https://internal.csa.sungard.com/HTML5/).

If you want to dig deeper and look at the code of an app that uses only this package, the [HTML5 Framework Mobile Shell](https://services.sungard.com/git/projects/HTML5/repos/html5-framework-mobile-shell) demo app is a good example. You can see a deployed version of this code by visiting the [Mobile Shell Demo app](https://internal.csa.sungard.com/HTML5-mobile/) preferably on a phone or an emulator.
