# HTML5 Framework Mega Menu

version: 3.1.3

**Compatible with v1.5.0+ of the HTML5 Framework**

The mega menu navigation component for the HTML5 Framework. For more information on how to use the fisMegaMenu directive this module provides, visit [its wiki page](https://www.csa.sungard.com/wiki/x/D9dJAw).

The megamenu is now a separate module and is not incorporated in the HTML5 framework core since 1.5.0-beta4.

## Installating In Your App

```
bower install --save https://services.sungard.com/git/scm/html5/html5-framework-mega-menu.git
```

This will automatically add the JavaScript files in your index.html file if you have started your project using the HTML5 Yeoman Generator v2.0.0+ if that is not the case, then you will need to insert one of the dist files in your index.html file:

```
<script src="[directory from .bowerrc file]/fis-mega-menu/dist/fis-mega-menu.js"></script>
```

## Setup

After cloning the project repository, you will need to run both commands from the project's folder:

    $ npm install
    $ bower install

Please note that these commands require the dependencies listed at the end of this README file.


## Usage

- `grunt server` Runs a [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) based server for locally testing your application.
- `grunt test` Runs all the [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/) tests available on test/spec folder.
- `grunt build` Build the distribution version of your project in `dist/` folder.
- `grunt jshint` Validates your javascript code with [jshint](http://www.jshint.com/).
- `grunt release --setversion=1.0.0` Creates a new release of the project, using the [grunt-bump plugin](https://github.com/vojtajina/grunt-bump).

*Note: All these commands require the latest version of [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) installed; if you need help, check the [installing Grunt page on wiki](https://www.csa.sungard.com/wiki/x/HIUzAw).*
