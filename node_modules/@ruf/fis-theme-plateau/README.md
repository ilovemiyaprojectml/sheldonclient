Plateau Theme
=========

Pleateau is a theme based on the [Camino Specification] for the [SunGard HTML 5 Rich Client Framework].


## Setup development environment

To setup your development environment you will need Bower installed to get all dependencies.

From a command-line interface, just run the following command from the same folder of the cloned repo:

    $ bower install

In order to test your changes, you will need a demo application, and link this application to your cloned repo.
You can find a demo application here:

- <https://services.sungard.com/git/projects/H5DT/repos/camino-plateau-demo-app/browse>

### Linking bower packages for development

You can link the current development folder directly to your demo application using Bower, it provides a [link command, that is better explained here](https://oncletom.io/2013/live-development-bower-component/).

It is basically consisted of two steps, first make your package globally available for linking in your system:

    $ cd html-theme-plateau
    $ bower link

That will make *fis-theme-plateau* a global package in your system, ready to be linked.

Now you just need to navigate to your demo app folder and use Bower to link the theme as a package.

    $ cd camino-plateau-demo-app
    $ bower link fis-theme-plateau
